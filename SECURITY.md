# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 3.x (main) | Yes |
| 2.x (upstream SoftHSM2) | No — report to [opendnssec/SoftHSMv2](https://github.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv2) |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not file a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Please report security issues via **GitHub's private security advisory** feature:

1. Go to <https://github.com/pqctoday/softhsmv3/security/advisories>
2. Click **"New draft security advisory"**
3. Fill in the title, severity, description, and steps to reproduce

We aim to acknowledge reports within **2 business days** and provide a fix
timeline within **7 business days** for critical issues.

## Scope

Issues in scope:
- Memory safety bugs (use-after-free, buffer overflow, integer overflow/underflow) in the PKCS#11 layer or crypto backend
- Cryptographic weaknesses introduced by this fork (not upstream OpenSSL/SoftHSM2 issues)
- PIN or key material leakage via timing side-channels, logging, or improper memory clearing
- WASM build issues that expose secret key material to JavaScript callers beyond the intended API

Out of scope:
- Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL itself (report to <https://openssl.org/policies/general/security-policy.html>)
- Attacks requiring physical access to the host system
- Denial-of-service via resource exhaustion (treat as a regular bug)

## Security Design Notes

- Key material is stored masked in memory (`SecureDataManager`) with per-operation local AES instances to avoid shared cipher state races
- `SecureAllocator` + `mlock()` prevent secret buffers from being swapped to disk
- PBE key derivation uses PBKDF2-SHA256 with a random 256-bit salt per wrapped key blob
- PKCS#11 v3.2 `C_EncapsulateKey` / `C_DecapsulateKey` use ML-KEM (FIPS 203) via OpenSSL EVP
- All EVP contexts are freed on every code path; no ENGINE API is used

## WASM Security Limitations

When built for WebAssembly (Emscripten or wasm32-unknown-unknown), the following platform-level security guarantees do **not** apply:

- **No secure memory**: `mlock()`, `madvise(MADV_DONTDUMP)`, and `SecureAllocator` are no-ops. Key material in WASM linear memory may be observable by the host JavaScript environment and is subject to garbage collection and memory snapshots.
- **Exposed linear memory**: WASM modules export their entire linear memory as an `ArrayBuffer`. Any JavaScript code in the same origin can read all key material directly via `Module.HEAPU8`.
- **No ASLR or memory isolation**: WASM linear memory has a fixed, deterministic layout. Memory addresses are predictable and cannot be randomized.
- **Maximum memory cap**: The WASM build is capped at 512 MB (`MAXIMUM_MEMORY=536870912`) to prevent unbounded growth.

### Required HTTP Headers

Deployments serving the WASM module **must** set these response headers to enable `SharedArrayBuffer` (required by Emscripten pthreads):

```
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
```

### Recommendations for WASM Consumers

1. Treat the WASM HSM as an **educational/development tool**, not a production HSM
2. Never store production secrets in the WASM module's object store
3. Serve the module only over HTTPS with the required CORP/COOP headers
4. Use `Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'` to prevent code injection
5. Zeroize keys via `C_DestroyObject` when no longer needed (the Rust module zeroizes `CKA_VALUE` on destroy)

## Disclosure Policy

Once a fix is merged and released, we will:
1. Publish a GitHub Security Advisory with full details
2. Add an entry to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) under the release version
3. Tag a new release within 24 hours of the advisory publication
