# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** March 22, 2026
**Last Updated:** March 22, 2026

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing, downloading, or using SoftHSMv3 (the "Software"), available at [https://github.com/pqctoday/softhsmv3](https://github.com/pqctoday/softhsmv3) and its associated npm package (`@pqctoday/softhsm-wasm`), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not access or use the Software.

## 2. License

The Software is licensed under the **BSD 2-Clause License** (same as the upstream SoftHSM2 project). The full license text is available in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file. Nothing in these Terms restricts rights granted under the BSD 2-Clause License.

## 3. Purpose and Cryptographic Disclaimer

SoftHSMv3 is a **PQC-enabled HSM emulation library** forked from SoftHSM2 v2.7.0. It implements PKCS#11 v3.2 with ML-KEM (FIPS 203), ML-DSA (FIPS 204), and SLH-DSA (FIPS 205) support. It is intended for **development, testing, education, and prototyping purposes**.

**You must not:**

- Use the Software as a substitute for a certified hardware security module (HSM) in production environments.
- Rely on the Software for protecting real cryptographic keys, production credentials, or financial transactions.
- Treat the Software as FIPS 140-3 validated — it is not. The Software emulates PKCS#11 v3.2 operations in software (and WebAssembly) without the tamper-resistance guarantees of a hardware HSM.

## 4. Export Compliance and Sanctions

### 4.1 Classification

The Software contains cryptographic functionality classified under **Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 5D002** pursuant to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR). This includes but is not limited to: OpenSSL-backed implementations of ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, AES, RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, and key derivation mechanisms.

### 4.2 License Exception

Distribution is authorized under **License Exception TSU (§740.13 EAR)** for publicly available encryption source code and **License Exception ENC (§740.17 EAR)** for mass-market encryption software.

### 4.3 Prohibited Destinations

You may not access, download, or use the Software if you are located in, or a national or resident of, any country or territory subject to comprehensive U.S. sanctions, including but not limited to:

- Cuba
- Iran
- North Korea (DPRK)
- Syria
- The Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions of Ukraine

### 4.4 Denied Parties

You may not access or use the Software if you are listed on, or acting on behalf of any party listed on, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Entity List, the U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List, or any other applicable restricted party list.

### 4.5 User Responsibility

You are solely responsible for complying with all applicable export control and sanctions laws in your jurisdiction. By using the Software, you represent and warrant that you are not located in a prohibited destination and are not a denied party.

## 5. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the Software for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.
- Misrepresent the Software as your own creation or remove attribution and license notices.
- Use the Software to develop weapons, conduct surveillance, or engage in any activity that violates human rights.
- Represent the Software as a certified or validated cryptographic module (FIPS 140-3, Common Criteria, or equivalent) unless you have independently obtained such certification.

## 6. No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. This is consistent with the BSD 2-Clause License.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE MAINTAINERS, CONTRIBUTORS, AND AFFILIATES OF SOFTHSMV3 SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE.

## 8. Third-Party Components

The Software incorporates or depends on third-party components including:

- **SoftHSM2** (OpenDNSSEC project) — original upstream, BSD 2-Clause
- **OpenSSL** — Apache 2.0 License
- **OASIS PKCS#11 v3.2 headers** — OASIS IPR Policy

Each component is subject to its own license terms.

## 9. Intellectual Property

- The Software's source code is licensed under BSD 2-Clause.
- PQC algorithm implementations (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA) are based on NIST FIPS 203/204/205 standards, which are in the public domain.
- The PKCS#11 v3.2 specification is published by OASIS under its IPR Policy.

## 10. Modifications

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be indicated by updating the "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the Software after changes constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.

## 11. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

## 12. Contact

For questions about these Terms, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/pqctoday/softhsmv3/issues) or contact the maintainers through the repository.
