 * posix_stubs.c — Stubs for POSIX functions absent from Emscripten sysroot.
 *
 * strongSwan links code paths that are never reached in the WASM build
 * (kernel-netlink plugin, fork-based privsep, DNS-based SRV lookups, etc.).
 * Emscripten's sysroot doesn't provide every POSIX function these reference,
 * and a missing symbol at link time fails the whole build.  These no-op
 * stubs satisfy the linker for symbols whose runtime callsites we don't
 * exercise in WASM.
 *
 * If any of these stubs is actually called at runtime, it returns a benign
 * error — safer than silent corruption.  Extend as new linker gaps surface.
